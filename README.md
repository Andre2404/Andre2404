## Quick overview

#### GitHub Stats

NOTE: This does not indicate my skill level or language proficiency, it's merely a GitHub metric of which languages I have the most code of on GitHub.

### What I do

I do Open Source. In fact, I do Open Source so much, that 95% of my work on
GitHub is free and open to everyone. I am really passionate about doing web
development, it is in my opinion the best combination of logical programming and
(sometimes) beautiful design.
